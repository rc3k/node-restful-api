# Node Restful API

A sample Restful API for a single entity built in Express and Mongoose, with separation of concerns into routes, model, and controller. Tests use Mocha and Sinon, and are a mixture of integration tests that use a test database for the model, and unit tests for the controller.

This repository includes serverless configuration for deployment to AWS Lambda with a connection to a MongoDB Atlas Cluster.

The purpose of the API is purely for reference when building larger scale projects.
